China,Virtual screening of prodrugs,Nanjing University Of Posts And Telecommunications,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/virtual-screening-of-prodrugs/,Wenyong Zhu | Guwei Sun | Jingzhou Yuan,"With the rapid development of life sciences at the end of the last century, the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) and the implementation of the follow-up functional genomics program, drug research and medical drug industry have entered a new historical period.

As we all know, the development of new drugs is a high-input, inefficient work. With the rapid development of computer chemistry and biology in the 21st century, virtual drug screening technology has become an important branch of drug chemistry development. However, the establishment of a reasonable pharmacophore model to accurately determine or predict the molecular structure of the target protein, accurate and rapid calculation of candidate compounds and target interaction between the free energy change is the key to virtual drug screening, but also to limit the accuracy of virtual screening bottleneck.

Virtual screening techniques can be divided into two types based on the receptor biomacromolecule structure and the ligand-based small molecule. Virtual screening often requires good predictive performance in practical drug design commercial applications. There are a large number of virtual screening methods based on machine learning, which are used to extract the characteristics of compound molecules, such as various molecular fingerprints and molecular descriptors, and use Bayesian statistical methods, nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines and artificial neural Network and other machine learning methods for compound molecules for high-throughput virtual screening. In particular, in recent years, in-depth learning methods have been successfully applied to the study of ligand-based drug virtual screening and molecular fingerprint generation, and show better predictive performance.

Based on the virtual learning method of machine learning, the general practice is to use software to obtain fixed-length compound characteristics, including molecular fingerprints and molecular descriptors, and then call the machine learning method to build the model. However, the manual extraction of these general methods is usually associated with a semantics that is immutable and independent of the corresponding drug target and its activity activity, which can not compensate for the characteristics of manual extraction and the activity values ​​acting on different drug targets The gap. At present, molecular fingerprints with good properties are usually larger in virtual screening based on ligand activity. The Therefore, in today's actual virtual drug screening, an urgent need to be able to get relatively short, better performance of the molecular fingerprint generation method"

     A SAV test is designed to differentiate between authentic and fake users. Online and mobile app-based account fraud is an epidemic that is impacting companies and their users on a global scale. In many cases, the trouble begins when “bad actors” are able to register for accounts. With user bases considered a critical asset with an average value of $117 million, companies need to prevent these users from entering their ecosystem.
When an user account is not verified, the companies risk, allowing bad actors into their User Base. 82% of companies surveyed confirm fake users are a problem; 44% report them as a significant problem. Once fake users are registered, they can easily create more accounts and wreak havoc.Hence we are on a mission to save  the Internet ecosystem from fraud, fake users and machine designed to generated human like responses by helping to identify the truth with the aid of SAV."

China,BEAUTIFUL SLIECE,Nanjing University Of Posts And Telecommunications,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/beautiful-sliece/,Zhang Jian | Huo YouLiang | Ran JunYao,"Citing the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) data, there are about 70 million deaf-mutes in the world, which is more than 1% of the world's total population. As a special group in society, deaf-mutes often rely on sign language to communicate and learn knowledge due to their own hearing impairment. 
At present, the most common way to learn sign language is to learn from lexicon teachers in special schools with the contents of sign language teaching materials. However, since the number of sign language teachers is far less than the number of deaf students, it is difficult for teachers to ensure teaching quality for each student. This shortage of educational resources is especially evident in underdeveloped areas. If an efficient sign language learning APP is set up to assist teachers in teaching and tailoring sign language learning programs to each and every student and to track the their learning quality so as to give consideration to everyone, it is a powerful weapon to the shortage of education resources. At present, there is currently a small amount of software for sign language learning on the market, and various problems exist in existing software. One of the most prominent problems is that existing sign language learning software can only display the hand movements, while neglecting the facial expressions and torso movements. It is the facial expressions and torso movements that play a key role in the expression of sign language emotion information. In addition, most sign language learning software is in the form of still pictures, teaching by tracing gestures which has poor user friendliness and difficult to learn sign language. To overcome the above shortcomings, the project will simulate human facial expressions and trunk movements for different scenes through the method of sentiment analysis. Combining with the hand movements, the project will eventually be presented in the form of animation to make the sign language expression approach the real effect. 
To sum up, this project intends to design a set of personalized deaf and mute teaching system, which consists of two parts: sign language teaching and speech-sign language translation."

In the different areas, despite having large tracts of fertile lands majority are not used and left uncultivated, while establishing food security is a continuing and sometimes daunting struggle, not only because of global warming and other uncontrollable factors such as destructive weather, but also the lack of young farmers doing the job. The worldwide average age of farmers is around 60, which is increasing at an alarming rate, that is why the known solution is to automate some processes that farmers do. However, it is still for naught as relying one source of food supply could lead to detrimental consequences to the food security of every household. 
To help compensate for the lack of farmers, individuals who have no clue about farming must have a way to grow its own crop.

All the steps which included human intervention is now given to a deeply learned software that would generate,detect and alert on the basis of the input provided.

Thus the culprit may move to any place of the world,if their are cameras or any link to a visual recording being used at places the software would filter out results from the input and will try to identify the suspect's 3D figure.

Thus initiating with a prototype generally requires with the cost of making it and its sucess rate,thus it would include-

->Estimating the basic cost of developing this prototype and its level of success attainment.

Malaysia,Semico ;,Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/semico/,Joshua Jebaraj | Abdullah Fakher | Filbert Joshua | Naavenesh Rao," Depression has been a major issue, that most commonly leads to suicide. Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.  Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20's. 

In recent suicide case, Linkin Park Vocalist, Chester Bennington has shed a light on depression and suicide.  We are here to develop an AI chat-bot that helps depressed individuals to talk and open up to without having the fear of being misjudged, which in return helps lessen their depression and suicidal thoughts.  The app name is based on a movement; Project Semicolon - stylized as Project; - is an American mental health nonprofit organization that primarily functions as an anti-suicide initiative. Based on the statistics of the organisation, most suicide cases; who have survived was related to depression."
India,SMART PARKING SOLUTIONS,Pune university,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/smart-parking-solutions/,YASH KULKARNI | VAIDEHI KULKARNI,"With the growing number of vehicles and the consequent shortage parking space, there is haphazard and totally unregulated parking of vehicles all over. The solution calls out for an automated parking system that not only regulates parking in a given area but also keeps the manual control to a bare minimum.
Traffic congestion caused by vehicle is an alarming problem at a global scale and it has been growing exponentially. Car parking problem is a major contributor and has been, still a major problem with increasing vehicle size in the luxurious segment and confined
parking spaces in urban cities. Searching for a parking space is a routine (and often frustrating) activity for many people in cities around the world. This search burns about one million barrels of the world’s oil every day. As the global population continues to urbanize, without a well-planned, convenience-driven retreat from the car these problems will worsen. With lots of innovations and smartness in things they all need to be intelligent too, don't they?

India,Meal Preppers,PES University,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/meal-preppers/,Harshini D | Bhagyashree B R,"          In this busy everyday life of ours,  people have grown to admit that compromise and sacrifice are some of the key components for a blissful and harmonious coexistence.  This isn't necessarily always true and one of the areas people are unfortunately compromising on is - Food.   Lack of time and energy level is what is causing us to pay lesser attention to what we feed our system, not to mention the poisonous promise of convenience  fast food offers, be it through taste or lesser time spent waiting for food to be served  .
          Food is one of the next to basic necessities of life ( after oxygen, water, shelter and clothing) and we need to be paying more attention to what we take in than what we have been led to believe.  Our body can also be as efficient as the quality of its fuel( here, food). What we should be foreseeing in the near future as far as this important gateway to good health is concerned is  - to reduce the appeal junk, fast, preserved and canned food has on us by provide significantly better alternatives which are just as ""tasty"" and whose effect  on our performance (physically and mentally) can be observed for the better in no time.
          This is where Meal Preppers come in and with our effective solution taking into account problems faced when  people switch to healthy is what is going to make us stand out in a domain with such fierce competition. We have identified two parameters which actually determines what people  eat ( time and energy level) and  what should determine what people eat. ( how many calories they require based on their lifestyle). Taking into account these two parameters, we have raked up an algorithm which is gonna make not just planning your meals but also prepping them (based on your need) oh-so-easy. We also provide bonus  materials like monthly detoxes, everyday mindfulness along with tracking so this can be your go-to  health monitor. Moreover, all this is incorporated using AI  which makes it all the more cooler."

It's a wonderfully designed messenger bot  that is smooth and easy to use. 
It uses a natural language processing and understanding to give fast and reliable answers to users.
It replies to questions in the most human way and understands automatically the language you’re using. So the more people talk to it the smarter it becomes.
Gindima's most intuitive feature is that it is like an improved search engine helping the user to search and access the right information. 
The bot is equipped with different responses to all sorts of questions such as : where to find the nearby drugstore ? the nearby restaurant ? the nearby gas station ? which are the process for a renewal of passport...etc...
When smartphones first came to the consumer market, most people enjoyed downloading apps, now the novelty has worn off most consumers don't download apps. So anyone can use Gindima without having the need to download it ! Just use it as a friend who knows everything!"
India,Virtual Friend- Kudo,PES University,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/virtual-friend-kudo/,Shikhar Gupta | Smruti Inamdar,"Our idea is  to create a personal chat bot  like a friend-bot who knows everything about you 
Whenever you  feel lonely or you are sad and no one is there to talk to you 
and due to some reason you cant approach your parents you  can just talk to this bot . 
it can help you in any issue.
It is going to track user's current mood , asks a few simple questions . These questions are based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which is considered as the best form of talk therapy .
Although a bot can never replace a real therapist , it digs deeper into the user's mood and recommends to do something to cheer him/her up .

More the user talks to the bot , better help he is going to get.
  
BEWARE it knows everything about you , but there is nothing to worry about as it is not going to tell it anyone.   : )

After many long hours of rumination and thought on how we could contribute to the ever growing interest in this technology with our abilities, we chose to focus our efforts on a recurring problem we all experienced in our different work placements: the ever present state of the art most companies need. Despite us all working in very different environments, we all felt as thought there was progress to be made in this field, considering remedying to this problem is a tedious work for engineers, whose time would be much better spent elsewhere. Our chatbot, Elyo, positions itself as the solution to this problem. Thanks to it's minimalist and efficient interface, learning about the latest available technologies has never been simpler, whatever the size of the project. Elyo will always be able to give you access to the information you need to stay at the top of your field.

Once arrived, and after thorough analysis of his phone, the agent told him that there was no problem with his phone cellular and that he did panick for nothing.

The areas that grave consequences can be noted are in the “playgrounds” of our youth. 54% of teens have witnessed cyberbullying online, and among them 39% have reported in observing these occurrences on facebook, while the remaining percentage attributed Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram as other cyberbullying locations (Cox, 2014).These virtual playgrounds ranging from Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and many more social network services have become a mining zone for perpetrators of crime. Teenagers, adolescents who are sensitive to peer recognition and pressure are victims of the perpetual written abuse and attacks (Schneider et al., 2012). It has been found that over 50% of cyberbullied individuals are also victims of offline bullying cases in school  (Schneider et al., 2012). Thus, these potential overlap of cyberbullying and traditional bullying cases have complicated evaluating preventative measures by teachers and school administrators. The pace at which cyberbullying cases have escalated to 88% over the course of 2011-2016 according to NSPCC due to the ease at which the bullies maintain anonymity and on how accountability is harder to trace back to these individuals. In most cases, cyberbullying can be defined as insulting criticisms and harassment online via the internet, emails, and mobile communication devices (Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2008). The power differentials that are apparent in traditional bullying forms in most cases are hidden under the veil of anonymity in cyberbullying (Mark & Ratliffe, 2011). 

Cyberbullying has escalated on widespread scale in the past decade among adolescents through social media. This problem is critical for society due to the fact that the youth feel helpless in the face of such online abuse that occurs beyond the school environment.  My Sulli is an AI chatbot for popular social media platforms that responds  24/7  to teenagers who are dealing with cyberbullying problems in order to help relieve their  pressure and emotional distress.

To create a  tool which will monitor  the quality of air of our environment.
To explain the differnt gases present in and around the environment.
And display the result on LCD.
The main objective of the project” REAL TIME AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM”Is to find the amount of gases present in the atmosphere which are responsible for air pollution such as CH4, NO2,LPG,and CO , to display the amount of gases using LCD, to give the indication about safe or dangerous levels in a particular area by comparing with threshold levels and save the information in the SD card.
 The data is simultaneously sent to the cloud and can be accessed at any time using internet. The  Wi-Fi  shield is used to send the data to cloud. The data can be stored in the cloud along with the time. After analyzing for few days there is a chance of getting an overview about the pollution levels in that area.
 There by the pollution  control board can suggest the government to take necessary preventive steps such as diverting the traffic in that area or construction  of flyovers. Hence the “Real –Time Air Pollution Monitoring System” will be used for analyzing and reducing the pollution and for creating the awareness among the people.
 Sensor networks are currently and active research area mainly due to the potential of the applications. And these abstract we investigate the use of real time air pollution monitoring system. With the fast growing industries, one of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is environmental pollution. 
The level of increased with times by lot of factors like the increase in population, increased level of pollution vehicle use, industrialization and urbanization which results in harmful effects on human wellbeing by directly affecting health of humans exposed to it. The proposed  real time air pollution system make use of air quality index which is  presently  not available in  some areas. These system help the society to increase the quality of their life and overall health of people at risk.
 Have the ability of to monitor and record the pollution can help to shape our daily activities.

The aim of this application is to tackle health in general, but more specifically mental health issues with a particular focus on student well-being. Some of the features the conversational application would have include reminders for medication, mood conversations, medical records, meditation mode, suggestions for reading material on the topic and more. The interactivity is where the artificial intelligence comes in, where the user is able to feel more comfortable communicating with a friendlier interface that, in essence, plays the role of a therapist. Additionally, a mobile application will be created for the user to add extra information (such as health records, etc.) that will then be used by Alexa as a database. This mobile application will also serve as an “on the go” version of the chatbot."

This is particularly true of the doctor-to-population ratio and the number of hospitals. As of 2004, according to the World Bank, the average health workforce per 100,000 (one hundred thousand) people in Sub-Saharan Africa is 15.5. Even today this has not changed a lot. One of the consequences is that physicians are overwhelmed by the number of patients. Their efficiency diminishes with tiredness. As for the patients, they have to queue for a long time before being able to see a physician. Also some people are far from any kind of medical center. These make people turn to self-medication because of the accessibility of health care.We want to build a mobile application that will allow users to get diagnosis and prescriptions for their disease by discussing with a chatbot. The user will have the opportunity to find the nearest pharmacy. Also the platform will allow for health awareness campaigns (epidemic, vaccination campaign, ...).
As chatbots do not have any specific goal that guides the interaction, the difficulty of evaluation is intrinsic as each conversation is interactive, and the same conversation will not occur more than once; one slightly different answer will lead to a completely different conversation; moreover there is no clear sense of when such a conversation is “complete”. More still, identifying an appropriate database is a challenge as well. Fortunately, chatbots have recently become the focus of greater research interest. As such many solutions are already available to mimic some challenges significantly. All these allows us to confidently believe in this idea."

These three assailants were supported to undertake their actions through several technologies such as social media. Unfortunately, the case of Brussels airport bombing isn’t an isolated one, in the increasingly digital world individuals are more than ever empowered to undertake actions that could harm our society. The broadened threat landscape, originating from the digital world, requires a different mind-set within our law enforcement agencies. To enhance their performance and fulfil their role as protectors of our society they’ll have to evolve and adopt a proactive stance on security. This proactive stance can be achieved by a continuous analysis of recorded visual material which will highlight suspicious behaviour and enable our law enforcement agencies to intervene before the crime occurs. In order to achieve such a feat, an ecosystem must be put in place which builds on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, the Internet of Things and Distributed Ledger Technologies harmoniously functioning together."

We believe website navigation is one of the most overlooked part of converting visitors to customers. We're not just talking about UX design that helps the user know where to click. We're talking about instant information accessibility and customer satisfaction. 

Imagine going to, say, a bank's website--one you've never been to before--to get rates on college loans. You want the right information fast, without having to click through a million links to get to a tiny FAQ page with a vague response, or have to do another Google search just to get the same page. Better yet, you want to get all the information you need in the next 30 seconds without having to pick up the phone, be put on hold, and finally ask your questions to a sales agent. 

This is where Woohoobot comes in. Woohoobot solves the problem of difficult-to-navigate websites and limited human resources. It turns a website into a real-time interactive sales agent that can respond to complicated questions (spoken or typed), navigate users to the correct pages based on their questions, and make the browsing experience easier and far more accessible by providing multiple communication channels for the user. Customized by each company, Woohoobot becomes a lightning quick, accurate sales agent--without the long waiting queue. "

Skin disorders vary greatly in symptoms and severity. They can be temporary or permanent, and may be painless or painful. Some have situational causes, while others may be genetic. Some skin conditions are minor, and others can be life-threatening. Many of these diseases can be very dangerous, particularly if not treated at an early stage. Human behavior, particularly in developing countries like India, tends to assume skin diseases as minor till it become serious. Most of the time, persons may not be aware of the dangerousness of their skin diseases, for instance skin cancers, psoriatic, etc.; and sometimes most of them try to treat these infections using their own method. However, if the treatments are not suitable for that particular skin problem then it would worsen the situation. Skin diseases tend to pass on from one person to another very easily and therefore it is important to control it at initial stages to prevent it from spreading. Also skin damage may sometimes lower the mental confidence and well-being of people. 
In addition to it, the pattern of skin diseases in India is influenced by the developing economy, level of literacy, social backwardness, varied climate, and industrialization, access to primary health care, and different religious ritual and cultural factors. The prevalence of skin diseases in the general population has varied from 7.86% to 11.16% in various studies. Skin diseases also pose huge financial, psychological burden for the patients and their families. 
This objective is to develop an open Android/iOS/Windows platform based application (App) which would diagnose skin diseases of the patients.

Some are capable of pre-diagnosing patients’ basic sickness if given the symptoms. While others are capable of handling follow-up medical cares which is of help to patients in reminding their check-ups after hospital admission. However, these features can still be improved through more researches.

JoJo offers innovation to the existing HealthBots. Just like any other bots similar to JoJo, he can pre-diagnose common diseases and give advise on how to avoid them. Also, he is capable of reminding medications and follow-up check-ups, and educating users about the use of OTC drugs. But more than that, JoJo's major function is its capability to provide emergency hotlines and contact numbers when needed by the user. He also can book appointments to doctors based on the user's necessity and location.

JoJo targets to help the end-users and businesses under the healthcare industry. The cooperation of privately and publicly owned hospitals and clinics would mean a lot. Partnerships between these entities would lead to a broader network of healthcare providers where patients can run to in times of need of medical attentions. JoJo can bridge the gap between these businesses and the patients, thus, would promote health among communities.

The growing attention for the recognition of people with an anxiety disorder or depression is still low among the society.  Despite, it is an important condition to ensure accurate treatment, however, the symptoms seem ubiquity and hard to trace. Therefore, by giving any kind of therapy to the subjects directly without knowing their condition is meaningless and very insulting. In this project, we proposed a linguistic analysis engine that works together with autonomous online friendly Chabot called My Tomodachi to address the issue. First, autonomous online friendly chatbot will be used as a mechanism to approach the subject as the best buddy. A text-based daily conversation buddy model will be applied in our main proposed framework in order to collect all necessary information about the subject. Second, a new mechanism to analyze all necessary information by using our proposed linguistic analysis engine will be used. The engines will able to predict the possibility of depression and identify a proper therapy that suits the subject after going through an appropriate analysis based on the input. We believe that each people experience the different type of mental state and it may differ from each other depend on their background and lifestyle. In order to approach each person mental state specifically, a proper engine is needed to comply this diversity. With the capability of Chatbot and Ai technology that can work together with our proposed linguistic analysis engine (Natural Language Processing, data mining approach), we strongly believe that we will able to surpass the root of the problem. Throughout our deep investigation, it is proven that text-based content is considered as one of the most suitable mediums to provide large amounts of information that describe a person as a whole. With a strong combination of three different schools of thought such as Physiologist, Social Science and Artificial Intelligence to develop the engine, this proposed mechanism may become the remedy to the main problem.

There are Seven Heroes in the world corresponds to seven Continents .They used to protect there whole continents from the  dangerous threats . 
There is a Villon who used to make money and enjoy the luxuries. This Villon wants to defeat all super heroes and rule the world with all their super power with her. But this is not known to Super Heroes and more over this Villon is friendly to all those Super Heroes and  the each and every movement is well-known to that Villon.
Now, Here  there is a threat from the Villon to the world who is not easy to defeat by the power of individual super human.
Initially Each Continent is protected by Each Super Human. From the  Dangerous threats by Followers of Villon.  After protecting  the all Continents they get to know that there powers not enough to defeat the super Villon.
So they will make a Robot with Human intelligence and the Integrated power of 7 Super Humans.
But the Villon get to know it and takes that Robot and take the Micro chip from the Robot  and dismantle the parts from the Robot and place the parts of them in each Continent . 
But the Suspense is that the Secrete Power of the Robot is lies in the parts of the robot rather than the Micro Chip of the Robot. 
So Each Super Human goes to their Respective Continent and Struggle to get those parts and all together Meets at one place  and it is  Mumbai, India
Similarly Villon to makes a Robot  which is handled by the Villon.
There is the Final war in between the Villon  and the Robot made by the Super 7 Humans.

The other problems associated with autonomous farm equipment can probably be overcome with technology. This equipment may be in our future, but there are important reasons for thinking that it may not be just replacing the human driver with a computer. It may mean a rethinking of how crop production is done. Crop production may be done better and cheaper with a swarm of small machines than with a few large ones.

One of the advantages of the smaller machines is that they may be more acceptable to the non-farm community. The jobs in agriculture are a drag, dangerous, require intelligence and quick, though highly repetitive decisions hence robots can be rightly substituted with human operator. The higher quality products can be sensed by machines (color, firmness, weight, density, ripeness, size, shape) accurately.

Robots can improve the quality of our lives but there are downsides. The present situation in our country all the agricultural machine is working on manual operation otherwise by petrol engine or tractor is expensive, farmer can’t work for long time manually to avoid this problem, we need to have some kind of power source system to operate the digging machine."

Also, some of them cannot read the text which is at a larger distance and some cannot read which are very nearer to them. Due to their continuous reading, they may lose their eye sight. Braille code is another way of reading text done by the visually challenged people. But, reading a Braille script for longer duration results in swelling of fingers for the person reading the script. So, even this is not a solution for reading the text.
This proposed project “Text Reader” is a device which converts text in the printed material to a synthesized speech in real time. The hardware components are Raspberry pi3 model B, 8mp camera module, 3.5mm ear phones. Software used are optical character recognition (OCR), text- to- speech (TTS). The picture of printed material which is obtained by the camera is given as an input to OCR.OCR extracts the text from the image and the output of OCR i.e. an editable text is given as an input to TTS, which gives a synthesized speech. The speech can be heard through an audio jack earphones and audible feedback is given.

Talking glossary is an innovative technique that helps the visually challenged people to overcome the problems which they face during their educational training. It is an Talking Glossary which gives synonyms of words given by the user through Braille code. This system overcomes the real time difficulties of visually impaired people, thereby improving their learning ability. Though the Talking Glossary is available in the market, it is costlier and the users must know the operation of QWERTY keypad which is difficult for the blind.

Most of the times the guardians at the patients feel very stressed due to improper information and feel in secured in hospitals as the staff can't provide sufficient time to explain the condition of the patient. This can be prevented by developing an IP address for the Hospital's data base for which only the people inside the hospital can connect and access the information through a hotspot.

In 2017, this rate is estimated at 60% at the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar (UCAD).
This high failure rate can be explained by the difficult working, accommodation and catering conditions faced by students. However, a very important fact is often forgotten : it is the choice of the orientation of the student.
Indeed, if for some the choice is clear, it is not the same for many others. Almost all students complete their studies without ever consulting a guidance counselor, while the latter can contribute directly or indirectly to the student's success in his transition to higher education.
That is why we want to create a bot, which can accompany the student along his school curriculum to guarantee him the best orientation possible.
This bot can be consulted at any time and will be able to take into account the changes of the student's decision.

At high levels of acute exposure, lead attacks the brain and central nervous system to cause coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive acute lead poisoning are typically left with grossly obvious mental retardation and behavioral disruption. At lower levels of exposure that cause no obvious symptoms. Tubular and glomerular kidney effects in Swedish women with low environmental cadmium exposure.By using lead detector we can detect the lead content containing in vehicles separated from the dust particles. If it exceeds threshold level it will detect or else it won’t detect. Many people are aware of the lead in petrol and are concerned about what effect it may have on the health of their family. The National Health and Medical Research Council has set an Australian National Goal for all Australians to have a blood lead level below 10 µg/dL (micrograms per deciliter). For every 10µg/dL of lead in the blood, experts agree, that a child is at risk of losing between 2-3 IQ points. Once taken into the body, lead distributes throughout the body in the blood and is accumulated in the bones. Depending on the level of exposure, lead can adversely affect the nervous system, kidney function, immune system, reproductive and developmental systems and the cardiovascular system.  Lead exposure also affects the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood.  The lead effects most commonly encountered in current populations are neurological effects in children and cardiovascular effects (e.g., high blood pressure and heart disease) in adults. Infants and young children are especially sensitive to even low levels of lead, which may contribute to behavioral problems, learning deficits and lowered IQ. The majority of larger lead particles (still extremely small) will fallout within 30 meters from a busy road. The smaller ones can travel kilometers or even end up circling the earth. This prototype substitute significant reductions of all pollutants from diesel engines, and will continue to reduce these pollutants in the future.

People didn’t realize when the accident occurs and how they were treated with a first aid. Our idea tries to bring the solution for this problem.
From the past years there is a huge change in the technology. Once again this developed technology has come with the solution with the above problem.  The idea is purely based on the IOT (Internet-Of-Things).
 The main objective of this idea is to setup the sensors and GPS tracking camera on the distance indicators on roads to track the vehicles which are moving with a high speed. When the sensors track the vehicle it will send the information to near conducted security offices to stop the vehicle and send the alert messages to road side people and foot path people. The alert message will be send in either voice message via speakers or send the information with the humans who are worked in the security offices. The security offices are maintained at every 10 or 15 km distance. 
This will aware the people for to avoid the accidents. When this idea come with the people this will definitely reduce the accidents.
Even though this idea will give the notifications to the other vehicles on the roads.

Hence, there is a need of an efﬁcient system for Crowd Density Detection and Management . The primary problem this paper seeks to solve is to provide the user an intelligent Chatbot to keep a tab of Crowd Density Status in Rail Compartments of the approaching trains and FootOverBridges(FOBs) and the ChatBot also advices the users, as to which bridge and compartment they can take so as to prevent over crowding. The user can also use the bot to get the information about approaching train status on platforms and also to track Crowd density at booking counters. This problem is solved by using an Artificial Intelligence(AI) based system . An Image Processing Module is used for crowd and luggage detection. The amount of luggage, no. of adults and children thus detected are then compared to the preset threshold value for each of these parameters and hence our Neural network is trained to take appropriate decision. After comparison, the data is sent to the Bot through which the users can come to know the Crowd Density Status in Compartments and FOBs. Thus, redirecting them and preventing overcrowding. (For further details  and Understanding PLEASE refer the  attached PDF document  -Crowdies.pdf)."

Philippines,THOMAS the Fraubot,University Of Santo Tomas,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/thomas-the-fraubot/,Kyle Edward Escosia | Ezekiel David | Ian Louise Sentina | John Cedric Custodio,"Technology has significantly improved over the past century.  It has allowed users to increase level of convenience when it comes to business transactions.  Most people can easily transact online with ecommerce and even on physical store purchases.  This was made possible with the use of electronic money and credit cards.    
Alongside with the rise of the technology, risks have also increased.  Fraudulent transactions have been considered to be one of the most significant risks with the use of technology for purchases.  Fraud has been a consistent pain for the users and corporate businesses alike, for the past years.  This causes massive loss of money for both consumers and businesses.  The most common activities involving fraud include, but not limited to the following:
websites posing to be legitimate stores
purchases requiring continuous subscription fees and premium payments without the knowledge of buyer
valid purchases done from stolen credit card
online transfer of electronic money from existing bank accounts
valid transactions to aid money laundering 
In order to mitigate the risks and incidents of such scenarios, banks have been doing, mostly, manual, verification to the customers.  Usually, business thresholds are set in terms of customer’s buying behavior or amount of purchase, then banks do their verification over the phone by calling the customer.  One limitation of this however is when verifiers are already outside of working business hours which sometimes gives opportunity to fraudsters to commit their deed.  Also, customers experience the difficulty of disputing fraud transactions if these were not reported or addressed immediately.  It usually takes weeks and even more than a month to prove and reverse fraud transactions.
Given the strong need to prevent fraudulent activities, the team has conceptualized to create a chatbot that has a capability to do educated and well-calculated verification with the user.  The user will have little to no means to notice that this is a bot that they are chatting to.  Such automated verification will prove to have very significant benefits to both users and banks. Details are further discussed in detail on the description of the idea."
Philippines,Medibot,University Of Santo Tomas,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/medibot/,Rachel Monique Tumulak | Brian Paul Crisostomo | Jonas Vincent Samson | Jean Philip Juachon,"Diseases and various disorders have always been part of human lives, and humanity is always in pursuit in finding cure and treatments for such disorders.  This is where doctors and other medical professionals come into the picture.  And for them to be able to give appropriate treatment, it is therefore imperative to make accurate and precise diagnosis.  

Technology, on the other hand, has been continuously improving at a very rapid rate.  This allows people to be able to do something with convenience.  By being able to use technology, efficiency of services and processes has improved significantly, allowing businesses to serve more customers and therefore, increases profitability.

Artificial intelligence and chatbots has always been a very interesting part of technology.  This has served more people in a more “natural” way, allowing human-like communications without the physical need of a person to do the actual communication.  This field of knowledge is very helpful in initial interaction and data gathering from system users.  By integrating this with the help of machine learning, system accuracy is further increased by allowing the system to use historical data to search patterns to help the system make a decision similar to an actual human being

Given the benefits that can be achieved with technology, the team has considered an idea of applying technology on the field of medicine which is to assist doctors in performing medical diagnosis.  The team understands that doctors’ physical diagnosis is still irreplaceable but by applying AI and Chatbots, it will make the initial data gathering phase to be automated and much more efficient, saving time for the doctors and help them focus on actual diagnosis.  It would also be a great way suggest to doctors an initial list of highly probable diseases based on initial inputs, and therefore helping them to prioritize which further tests needs to be done to rule out diseases and make much more accurate diagnosis earlier.  On the user standpoint, it is also much easier for the user, if a system can be able to find and recommend suitable doctors for the possible disease or disorder that the patient experiences. Things will be much more simpler and easier for both patients and doctors.

Therefore, the group proposes a Chatbot system, which the team would like to call “Medibot,” that allows assisted medical diagnosis with capabilities for bridging the patient to doctors."

India,Travel Assistant,Indian Institute of Science,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/travel-assistant/,Himanshu Kumar | Sudarshan Nayak | Abhilash Jain | Manu Ghulyani,"Travelling in unknown lands has always been as unpleasant experience for most people because of communication and unawareness about local culture and administrative setup.  The idea of ‘Travel Assistant(TA)’ chat-bot is to put all the travel related information in the hand of a person who is planning to travel local, inter-city or international. It will help make travel decision easy and on the fly for local public as well as tourists.  It will assist a user in every aspect of the travel. Aim of the TA is to consolidate all the information related to user’s query and answer adequately based on factors (money, time, comfort) decided by the user himself. The Travel assistant will give information relating food, conveyance and stay for the tourist making his travel experience smooth and hassle free.  TA bot will  make travel experience smooth and hassle free thereby, deleting hard cultural and language boundaries existing in the world.  "
India,Chatbots for children,PES University,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/chatbots-for-children/,Priyanka Narendra | Priyansha Pathak | Shilpa Nair,"With changing times, people are getting more and more isolated. This starts from childhood. And as kids are getting more isolated, they either involve themselves in too much social media, or too much  video games, or do not involve themselves in anything.  The idea is to build a system that recognizes the pattern in the child's online behavior and help strike balance between play and study. It will provide an intellectual stimuli by striking conversation on a topic that interests the child and slowly digressing to  more educative topics and help the child learn and at the same time help improve his skill in his area of interest. And if the child does not engage in any social activities, the chatbot will divert conversations that helps the child become more social. It can also monitor the child's online activities and alert if the child is surfing any inappropriate sites."

A developer or service provide generally has a problem in getting to know the faults and loopholes in the applications/services provided to the customers . 
Solution-
Such  faults are brought into light by the clients who already  purchased the product and such clients may also give their views on how to fix these faults by giving reviews on the developer's or service provider's website or social media site. The problem is to filter out such faults and their solutions from a data of a bundle of reviews in a random order on an application and show these to   developers/service providers to help them getting aware of the solution of the problem which has arose. This will help  in providing better service to future customers so that the problem doesn't arise in to be built applications/services.

They provide innumerable features and advantages to a company. As such, accessing or even being able to use the database is a critical skill requirement for people working with it. AQT aims at removing this skill requirement once and for all by translating simple English questions into database queries and also (possibly) performing query optimization to achieve results on par or even better than what a normal employee can. This brings down the skill requirement to access and use a database much lower, allowing even employees without technical skills to directly use the database without relying on a member of the technical team! This not only speeds up different processes but also increases efficiency of the entire team. And the bot does all of this on a server-less system using lambda functions (explained later) which give results much faster than traditional databases.

An example of a query using AQT:- 
how many residential properties do we have with roof permits issued after 1/1//2002 in the state of Florida on homes built before 2002 ?
SQL conversion:
select count(distinct residential_property) from xyz.csv where true and preferdate >= date('2002-1-1') and yearbuilt <= 2002 and roof=1 and state = 'fl'

Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.

Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous Things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade,[3] with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.[4]

The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[5] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.

From the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automatic  resembling animals and humans, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control."

Most of the time, when children seek information on the internet, it is not adapted to them, both on substance and format, here we can control how and what is presented to the children. The second feature is that with this number of characters, the answer can not be precise enough, so the user has to keep asking questions to the ChatBot, which feeds his curiosity and encourage dialog, the best way to learn for a child.

	Banking is one of the vital things everyone in the world has to do since people now are more aware about the time value of money. Each individual is nowadays obliged to deal with banks one way or another. However, a lot of banks, unfortunately, have a very bad customer services system. Nearly in all banks in Egypt, one needs to wait for almost half an hour if he/she needs to do a normal transaction or any simple operation. It is very irritating to waste so much time waiting to do a simple transaction whereas it only takes a couple of minutes to do the actual transaction. The members in our team have been wondering about how life would be if there had been an easier way to deal with the poor banking customer-service system.

Solution Proposal

	Our team has been searching for a long while for a way to solve that significant problem, and we have come up with the idea of using AI at implementing a smart bot that can help the users to make all the operation he need regarding his banking issues within a few minutes from his/her smart phone. At the same time, this bot could help the user freeze all his/her balances in case one of his money cards was stolen. This bot is thought to be so secure that if your phone was stolen, no one would be able to know anything about your balance. This bot is expected to make a lot of lives much easier than it currently is.

Would not it be nice if there was someone or something to remind you? Say hi to JaneBot!
JaneBot is a Google Home app/Amazon Echo skill that will help senior citizens with forgetfulness. 
Older adults complain about forgetting things. According to helpguide.org, a trusted guide to mental and emotional health, these are considered normal memory lapses: forgetting where a person left something, forgetting names of people (i.e. calling a grandson by another name), forgetting appointments, etc.
After my colleagues and I observed this behavior in our relatives and friends, we recognized a need among senior citizens for an assistant that can remind them of what they forget. We came up with a variation of the Google Home app/Amazon Echo skill to use artificial intelligence to help seniors remember.

Chatbots, or conversational agents in French, are not new in themselves since already, ""chatterbots"" appeared in the 60s. This sudden craze for chatbots is explained by recent advances in artificial intelligence (automatic learning, automatic natural language processing, etc.), coupled with the rapid development of messaging applications. Everyone (private, businesses, public institutions etc.) wants a chatbot. A difficulty will be to be able to access all the chatbots that will be created without having to install them on our phone. Our solution is to create a personalized chatbot which, depending on the need, will connect to another chatbot and be able to have its information. Custom because just like Snapchat Bitmoji, each user can create the character of his chatbot and give it a name. He can visualize on a map the surrounding chatbots and connect to it.

States,BTM Solutions,Columbia University,https://www.atositchallenge.net/idea/btm-solutions/,Camilo Muñoz | Srujan Routhu,"BTM Solutions stands for Behind The Meter Solutions. We are a business that aspires to unlock automated demand response by using real time electricity price signals and interacting with the Internet of Things. While demand response is a multi-billion dollar business by itself, our solution will also pave the road for new AI, chatbot and IoT applications. We believe that automated demand response is at the crossroads of the power sector and these major digital markets. Guided by adequate electricity price signals, our behind the meter approach intends to start unveiling this mostly unexplored and potentially structurally disruptive market.

As clean energy policy successfully starts reshaping the supply side of electric grids around the world, an increasing amount of intermittent renewable energy sources are being deployed. However, because of their non-dispatchable nature, questions have been arising regarding their impact on grid structure and operation. Additionally, phenomena such as the “duck curve” in California have led some system operators to question the amount of renewable sources that a grid can support. As a consequence, the search for solutions to these problems has even become one of the focus areas of the International Energy Agency (VRE division - https://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/systemintegration/). However, while most solutions are aimed at making power supply more flexible, an increasing number of reports are pointing towards the importance of developing innovative demand side solutions.

In this grid transitioning context, we present an innovative demand side solution that can be divided in twofold. On one side, our solutions’ purpose is to collect real time wholesale electricity prices from a large basket of electric markets that are scattered around the globe. On the other side, it will use this unified and easy to access database to communicate with electrical and electronic devices through the IoT’s. Once communication is established, our service will use AI to hedge against high peak hour electricity prices whenever possible. This happens by suggesting to any equipment that holds some kind of storage capacity to either anticipate or postpone energy consumption for a while when prices are high. In addition, chatbots will be used to collect additional information from users of mobile devices. As mobile devices can be unplugged at any moment, chatbots will interact with users in search of information about battery needs for the near future. For example, a chatbot may ask a plug-in car owner who has just parked and plugged his vehicle if he intends to leave soon or if he/she plans on staying parked for the night. This is a practical example of how AI and chatbots can be used in automated demand response applications that can significantly contribute to reduce daily peak loads.

By doing so, BTM Solutions expects to generate system benefits for utilities and grid operators. We also expect to reduce electricity bills for end customer and potentially create new business opportunities for our partners. As a business that is being started by two policymakers with strong engineering backgrounds, BTM Solutions, hopes to create new technological applications that lead to groundbreaking energy sector innovations."
